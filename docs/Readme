This directory contains a draft of the user documentation for Gofer.
More precisely, the files in this directory are as follows:

	Readme		this file
	hype		a summary of the main features of Gofer
	ch*, appx_*	individual chapters and appendices for the
			main Gofer user manual (Gofer version 2.20)
			(126 pages)
	release.221	release notes for Gofer 2.21  (21 pages)
	release.228	release notes for Gofer 2.28  (49 pages)
        release.230     release notes for Gofer 2.30a (11 pages)
	goferdoc.tex	Jeroen Fokker's LaTeX version of the main
			Gofer user manual.

Several people have contributed man pages for Gofer:

	gofer.1		by Gary Leavens
	bowen.1		by Jonathan Bowen
	jeroen.1	by Jeroen Fokker

Feel free to use which ever one you prefer!

Some of the information in the earlier documentation is rather out
of date.  You have been warned!!!

Given the number of pages involved, you will probably want to be
selective about what you read and, in the interests of all of those
poor trees, selective about what you print -- particularly bearing in
mind the fact that this is only a draft and likely to change!  Another
point worth mentioning is that the files are just plain ASCII text
files -- they can be printed out without problem on a dot matrix
printer ...

Those of you with fancy printers and document preparation software may
be dissappointed that I haven't used anything more than ASCII text to
produce these documents.  The simple reason for this is that ASCII is
the only format that I can reasonably guarantee will be available on
all of the machines on which Gofer is used.

Entries marked with a `+' in the list below are likely to be of most
interest to those who are already familiar with Orwell.

These files may contain many errors; I would be grateful for any
corrections or suggestions!

If the format of these files is unsuitable for your printer, you may
like to get hold of a copy of the source code and page formatter from
which these documents were produced.  These should be available from
the same place that you obtained the files in this directory.
