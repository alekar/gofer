This directory contains scripts that can be used in a Unix based environment
to take care of initialisation and environment settings for the Gofer
interpreter and compiler:

  gofer    starts up the command line version of Gofer with a particular
           prelude and initial command line argument settings.  In addition,
           this scripts attempts to set suitable values for the EDITLINE
           variable, based on the value of EDITOR (if it has one).

           Written as a sh script, Mark Jones, March 1993
	   Some modification by Jonathan Bowen, August 1993

  goferc   Runs the Gofer compiler and compiles the resulting C code.
           Handles project files or individually listed files (filename
           suffix such as .gs must be used).

           Written as a csh script, Ian Holyer, March 1993

It is expected that each Gofer user on a given system will make copies of
these files in their own local file space and modify as necessary to give
their preferred settings for command line arguments etc.

The old subdirectory contains older script files which have been subsumed
by the two scripts above, but might be useful in some special situations.
