This directory contains the source code for the Gofer documentation.
It is made up of three files:

    usrguide.doc	User manual for version 2.20
    notes221.doc	Release notes for version 2.21
    notes228.doc	Release notes for version 2.28

and a crude page formatter for producing the plain ascii versions of
these documents.  I have no idea where the hacked up source for the
page formatter originally came from, but it is certainly in the public
domain ...
